    "# Transformers for Coxeter Group Word Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The word problem is one of historical problems in the computational group theory. In this project, I propose an approximated solution for this problem in the context of Coxeter group using GRU based encoder-decoder model. I introduce the theoretical background of the word computational problem and structure of the encoder-decoder model. The model reaches the accuracy of 0.8 on the validation set on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the generating result, I attach the attention mechanism to the model. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating the output sequence. The model with attention mechanism reaches the accuracy of 0.9 on the validation set on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backgrounds\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, a group is a set $G$ with a binary operation $* : G \\times G \\to G$. The operation is associative and the group has an identity $e$ along with an inverse element $a^{-1}$ for each $a \\in G$. Many familiar objects such as integers, matrices and rotations of geometry shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modern group theory was first developed by Galois, arising from his effort in finding solutions to high-order algebraic equations. Nowadays, thanks to its proper abstraction for symmetry, group theory is finding its application across many fields, especially physics, computer science and machine learning. Among all of such applications, sometimes we focus on the theoretical derivation, but there are always occasions where we need to do actual computations in groups, either to get instincts or to obtain potential patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important group is Coxeter group, which is a group generated by reflections across hyperplanes [2, 4]. It is a generalization of the symmetric group and is closely related to many other groups, including Weyl group, braid group and Artin group. Coxeter group is particularly important in the theory of reflection groups and hyperbolic geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word problem is a fundamental problem in the computational group theory, which asks whether two words represent the same element in a group. It is an undecidable problem in general, but in some groups, it is NP-complete. In Coxeter group, the word problem is known to be decidable, but it is still hard to find an efficient algorithm to solve it. If we can decide the unique normal form of a word, we can solve the word problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Heuristically, we have a group $G$ with a generating set $S$, that is to say any element $a \\in G$ can be written in the form $$ a = s_1 s_2 \\cdots s_k. $$. There are also equivalence called relations. For example, in the symmetric group $S_3$, we have generaters $(12), (23)$ relations such as $(12)(23)(12) = (23)(12)(23)$. A reduced word is a word that cannot be simplified by the relations. A word can correspond to multiple reduced words. The reduced word of a word that is lexically smallest is called the normal form of the word. Hence, we have a one-to-one correspondence between normal forms and elements in the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "In group theory, we use linguistic terminology to specify the representation of group elements, this is also where inspires me to apply modern language model. Here I will follow the conventions in book [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, an alphabet $S$ means a finite set of symbols, where the element of $S$ is called a letter. A string is a finite sequence of letters, which is to give $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, along with a mapping $w : [n] \\to S$, which is represented by list structure. A word over $S$ is a string over an alphabet $S \\cup S^{-1}$. Examples will be given in the following section. A language is a set of words over $S$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will propose an approximated solution for the decision of normal form in Coxeter group using generative models. The idea is to use an Encoder-decoder model with attention machanism to learn the mapping between words and normal forms, and then use the model to predict the normal form of a word. Main idea is inspired by the translation model in machine translation [5].\n",

    "### Attention Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention mechanism is a key component in many modern neural network architectures, particularly in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It was introduced to improve the performance of the Encoder-Decoder architecture on long sentences in sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous RNN Encoder-Decoder architecture, the encoder compresses all the input information into a fixed-length vector, and the decoder then expands this vector into the output sequence. This can lead to information loss when dealing with long sequences, as it's challenging to compress all necessary information of a long text into a fixed-size vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention mechanism addresses this issue by allowing the model to \"focus\" on different parts of the input sequence at each step of the output sequence. Instead of encoding the input sequence into a single fixed-length vector, the attention-equipped model creates **a set of \"annotation\" vectors**. When generating each word of the output sequence, the model uses the attention mechanism to create **a weighted sum** of these annotation vectors, thus forming a context vector for each output word. This context vector is then used to generate the output word.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"Images/bahdanau.png\" width=200/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "For this small scale model, Bahdanau Attention is usually a good choice. In the Bahdanau Attention mechanism, the attention weights (used to create the weighted sum of annotation vectors) are computed using **a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer**. The hidden state of the decoder and the annotation vector are used as inputs to this network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention mechanism improves the model's ability to handle long sequences, leading to better performance on tasks like machine translation. It allows the model to \"remember\" important parts of the input sequence, even if they're far from the current position in the sequence, leading to more accurate and coherent outputs."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I propose an approximated solution for the word problem in Coxeter group using generative models. The project turns out to not follow my initial plan in the beginning, as is briefed in the Homework 2. I have tried simple encoder structure, such as RNN, GRU, LSTM for one layer, and they do not appear to have an acceptable performance. And it is not until I adopt the Seq2Seq model with attention mechanism that the model starts to learn the pattern in the Coxeter group, with surprisingly high accuracy. The gap between this transformer-like structure and the simple stack of RNN is so huge that I have to check thoroughly about each training procedure. I think the surprising result is by all means a good example of the power of modern neural network architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although word problems of Coxeter word has long been solved in 1990s, and mathematicians have made numerous efforts to simplify the computation, the result of project is still much impressive and inspiring for me. The elastic structure of network, that support varying lengths of both input and target, and the efficiency and interpretability that attention mechanism brings, are really a good match for many computational problems in the scope of pure mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project treat word of Coxeter group as a language, and the normal form as a translation task to adapt the power of language model. In this way, classical objects such as polynomials, Young tableaus, and even the group itself, can be treated as a language with generalized set of languages. And those objects can also be benefited from recent advancement of natural language processing. This is only my primitive thoughts. And I will set out to explore more in the recent future."
